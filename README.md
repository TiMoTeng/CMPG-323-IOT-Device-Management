# CMPG-323-IOT-Device-Management
## Project Brief
  A developer’s ability to read and understand code is even more important than their ability to write code. As such, For this project I was given an existing 
  ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that needed to be enhanced and improved. As part of this project, I was expected to understand architectural patterns as well as pay 
  specific attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns – aligning to the requirements of the project.
